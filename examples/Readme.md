# Confer usage examples
I have compiled together *some* examples that might get you started with using my library. I have not covered everything though, because you can just check out the documentations for all the stuff. This file is just an index for the examples.

- [usage_example.cpp](usage_example.cpp): How to test using Confer.
- [custom_errors_class.cpp](custom_errors_class.cpp): How to define a custom error counter class for Confer.
